^ In 2017 I was a consulting engineer with 18F/cloud.gov
and I started crossing paths with a team at the DHS CTO
office that was just getting started building a "Software Factory" as the 
eventual platform on which DHS development teams would
build, test and run their products.

Convoluted system diagram

^The system diagram looked something like this slide
where basically everything from the DevOps landscape
had been vomited up into tiered system. And my heart sank.

"And how is this working out for customers already working
with this system?" I asked. 

And I think you can guess the answer.

I knew that this project was destined to fail (spoiler alert: it
did), and I knew that from working on teams that practiced agile 
development and lean product design -- and from working myself on
projects that failed.

But I wasn't in a position launch into a deep critique of their
approach, and I wished there was a pithy way to point out the
fundamental misstep they had made.

Now I know better, and when I see a proposal like this I think:

Poop Emoji

^poop. and not just metaphorical poo but I ponder literal
crap and the eons long

Evolution of Crap

(reveal: worm digestive system)

^Evolution of Crap and the evolution of digestive systems. Because millions 
of years the precursor to our dig system would've been akin to
a worms's digestive system, where the worm is continually eating,
the liver is continually producing bile, and the lower intestine
is continually pooping.

It's a simple system that works.

Evolution of Crap

(reveal: worm digestive system)
(reveal: human digestive system)
(highlight: gall bladder)

^By contrast, we don't eat continually. We eat meals, sometimes big ones,
and the bile produced by our liver is stored in our Gall bladder so
its available to digest those meals. 

It's a complex system that works, that evolved from a simple system that
worked

Gall's Law
* Every complex system that works has evolved from a simple system that works.

^So the crappy system diagram brings me around from crap to
worm crap, to human crap, to the Gall bladder, and I can invoke
Gall's Law:

Every complex system that works has evolved from a simple system that works.

* Mnemonic rule: 
  * a trick for recall (from Greek mnēmē "memory)
  * Crap -> Worm Crap -> Digestive systems -> Gall Bladder
* Eponymous Principle: Gall's Law:
  * a law named for a person (from Greek eponymos "given as a name)
  * Every complex system that works has evolved from a simple system that works.

Title Slide again

^Hi, I'm Peter Burkholder, and welcome to Mnemonic Rule for Eponymous
Principles. I'm currently a customer success engineer for Cloud.gov, the
US Government's Platform-as-a-Service for Public Servants. Before going to
work for .gov 8 years ago I worked for Chef Software, a few other startups, 
and before that, for research labs including the US National Institutes of
Health, Nat'l center for atmospheric researth, the Pacific NW Seismic Network
because I first came into Unix administration as a graduate student in 
seismology.

I'm glad to be here today to share with you the eponymous principles I have found 
useful in my work, and the mnemonic tricks I use to call them up, some context on how to apply them.

Caveat: Some of my mnemonic tricks are weird, stupid, embarrassing or all three.
You may want to come up with your own. Because I think there's real power
to eponymous principles

---

The power of Eponymous Principles
* Newtons Laws
  * E.g. Law of inertia
* Murphys Law
  * Everything that can go wrong will
  
^There is weight that is not merely
rhetorical "argument from authority" but should have
the backing of experience and empirical evidence. Because
while Murphys Law doesn't have evident per se, it is
still the backbone of our work in Disaster Recovery plan, 
business continuity plans and much else the SRE community does.

Back to Complex System Diagram

* I think you should bear Gall's Law in mind. The platforms
I've seen that work build out essential features,
ideally with a real customer, and then grow to add features & customers. 
Else: they collapse from their own weight.

^So now when come across a diagram like this one, I can 
ground a discussing that start with....

Gall's Law
* John Gall, M.D. with a focus on child development...
  * and complex systems
* 1975, Systemantics
  * A complex system designed from scratch never works, and cannot be patched ... to make it work. You have to start ... with a working simple system.

^And when they ask: What is Gall's Law?

# Conway's Law

* Organizations which design systems…are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations" (1968)
* Or: Your architecture will mirror your org chart
* _Mnemonic_: We CONstruct systems mirroring the WAY we communicate

^Pathological organization cultures and structures
will result in pathological technical systems

# The Inverse Conway Maneuver

* Build teams to achieve the desired architecture
* Tech: Used bounded contexts and APIs along team bounds
* Orgs: Consider _Team Topologies_ (Skelton and Pais, 2019)

Quiz: 

We have five teams assigned to a system that only has three 
major components. Time to apply an Inverse ________ Maneuver
so we don't end up with five subsystems.

Answer: CONWAY

We have five teams assigned to a system that only has three 
major components. Time to apply an Inverse Conway Maneuver
so we don't end up with five subsystems.

* We CONstruct systems the same WAY we're organized

Quiz:

This proposed architecture is too complex. We'll have to start
with a simpler initial _working_ solution, otherwise we're doomed
by _______ Law.

Answer: Gall's Law

This proposed architecture is too complex. We'll have to start
with a simpler initial _working_ solution, otherwise we're doomed
by Gall's Law.

* :poo: architecture -> digestion -> evolution -> Gall bladder

Closing: There's a lovely site called "Laws of Software" -- concise and helpful. I'm gong to contribute these to that site.

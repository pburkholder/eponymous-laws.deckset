^ In 2017 I was a consulting engineer with 18F/cloud.gov
and I started crossing paths with a team at the DHS CTO
office that was just getting started building a "Software Factory" as the 
eventual platform on which DHS development teams would
build, test and run their products.

Convoluted system diagram

^The system diagram looked something like this slide
where basically everything from the DevOps landscape
had been vomited up into tiered system. And my heart sank.

"And how is this working out for customers already working
with this system?" I asked. 

And I think you can guess the answer.

I knew that this project was destined to fail (spoiler alert: it
did), and I knew that from working on teams that practiced agile 
development and lean product design -- and from working myself on
projects that failed.

But I wasn't in a position launch into a deep critique of their
approach, and I wished there was a pithy way to point out the
fundamental misstep they had made.

Now I know better, and when I see a proposal like this I think:

Poop Emoji

^poop. and not just metaphorical poo but I ponder literal
crap and the eons long

Evolution of Crap

(reveal: worm digestive system)

^Evolution of Crap and the evolution of digestive systems. Because millions 
of years the precursor to our dig system would've been akin to
a worms's digestive system, where the worm is continually eating,
the liver is continually producing bile, and the lower intestine
is continually pooping.

It's a simple system that works.

Evolution of Crap

(reveal: worm digestive system)
(reveal: human digestive system)
(highlight: gall bladder)

^By contrast, we don't eat continually. We eat meals, sometimes big ones,
and the bile produced by our liver is stored in our Gall bladder so
its available to digest those meals. 

It's a complex system that works, that evolved from a simple system that
worked

Gall's Law
* Every complex system that works has evolved from a simple system that works.

^So the crappy system diagram brings me around from crap to
worm crap, to human crap, to the Gall bladder, and I can invoke
Gall's Law:

Every complex system that works has evolved from a simple system that works.

* Mnemonic rule: 
  * a trick for recall (from Greek mnēmē "memory)
  * Crap -> Worm Crap -> Digestive systems -> Gall Bladder
* Eponymous Principle: Gall's Law:
  * a law named for a person (from Greek eponymos "given as a name)
  * Every complex system that works has evolved from a simple system that works.

Title Slide again

^Hi, I'm Peter Burkholder, and welcome to Mnemonic Rule for Eponymous
Principles. I'm currently a customer success engineer for Cloud.gov, the
US Government's Platform-as-a-Service for Public Servants. Before going to
work for .gov 8 years ago I worked for Chef Software, a few other startups, 
and before that, for research labs including the US National Institutes of
Health, Nat'l center for atmospheric researth, the Pacific NW Seismic Network
because I first came into Unix administration as a graduate student in 
seismology.

I'm glad to be here today to share with you the eponymous principles I have found 
useful in my work, and the mnemonic tricks I use to call them up.

Caveat: Some of my mnemonic tricks are weird, stupid, embarrassing or all three.
You may want to come up with your own. Because I think there's real power
to eponymous principles

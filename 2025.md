# Mnemonic Rules for Eponymous Laws

# Brace yourself...


^ In 2017 I was a consulting engineer with 18F/cloud.gov
and I started crossing paths with a team at the DHS CTO
office that was just getting started building a "CloudFactory" as the 
eventual platform on which DHS development teams would
build, test and run their products.

^The system diagram looked something like this slide
where basically everything from the DevOps landscape
had been vomited up into tiered system. And my heart sank.

^"And how is this working out for customers already working
with this system?" I asked.

^And I think you can guess the answer: They had none

^I knew that this project was destined to fail (spoiler alert: it
did), and I knew that from working on teams that practiced agile 
development and lean product design -- and from working myself on
projects that failed.

^But I wasn't in a position launch into a deep critique of their
approach, and I wished there was a pithy way to point out the
fundamental misstep they had made.

# What I said:

* Yada, yada, Agile Development, blah, blah, blah, Lean Enterprise, ...

# What I needed:

* Eponymous Principle
  * a law named for a person (from Greek eponymos "given as a name")
* Mnemonic rule:
  * a trick for recall (from Greek mnÄ“mÄ“ "memory")

# Mnemonics

"To build a memory ... it has to be a little bit weird"
- Per Sederberg (Ohio State University)

* Good mnemonics are weird, perhaps a little gross, or embarrassing.
* Make them work for you

^They stick in your memory. So my though process now would run something like this:

crap and the eons long

# Evolution of Digestion and ðŸ’©

* Worm Digestion: 
  * A simple system that works
  * Eat continually, liver produces bile continuously
* Human digestion:
  * A complex systems that works
  * We eat big meals, liver stores bile in the **GALL** bladder
* **Gall**: Mnemonic for ...


^Evolution of Crap and the evolution of digestive systems. Because millions 
of years the precursor to our dig system would've been akin to
a worms's digestive system, where the worm is continually eating,
the liver is continually producing bile, and the lower intestine
is continually pooping.

^By contrast, we don't eat continually. We eat meals, sometimes big ones,
and the bile produced by our liver is stored in our Gall bladder so
its available to digest those meals. 

^It's a complex system that works, that evolved from a simple system that
worked

^And now we have our Mnenomic for

# Gall's Law

* "Every complex system that works has evolved from a simple system that works."
* John Gall, M.D. with a focus on child development...
  * and complex systems
* 1975, _Systemantics_
  * A complex system designed from scratch never works, and cannot be patched ... to make it work. You have to start ... with a working simple system.

^So the crappy system diagram brings me around from crap to
worm crap, to human crap, to the Gall bladder, and I can invoke
Gall's Law:

^Every complex system that works has evolved from a simple system that works.

^How this works...  And welcome!

# Mnemonic Tricks for Eponymous Principles

* Peter Burkholder _(he/him)_
* US Gov (Cloud.gov), Chef Software, ..., Research Labs
* Geophysicist

^Hi, I'm Peter Burkholder, and welcome to Mnemonic Rule for Eponymous
Principles. I'm currently a customer success engineer for Cloud.gov, the
US Government's Platform-as-a-Service for Public Servants. Before going to
work for .gov 8 years ago I worked for Chef Software, a few other startups, 
and before that, for research labs including the US National Institutes of
Health, Nat'l center for atmospheric researth, the Pacific NW Seismic Network
because I first came into Unix administration as a graduate student in 
seismology.

^I'm glad to be here today to share with you the eponymous principles I have found 
useful in my work, and the mnemonic tricks I use to call them up, some context on how to apply them.

^Caveat: Some of my mnemonic tricks are weird, stupid, embarrassing or all three.
You may want to come up with your own. Because I think there's real power
to eponymous principles

# The power of Eponymous Principles

* Newton's Laws
  * E.g. Law of inertia
* Murphy's Law
  * Everything that can go wrong will
* 
  
^There is weight that is not merely
rhetorical "argument from authority" but should have
the backing of experience and empirical evidence. Because
while Murphys Law doesn't have evident per se, it is
still the backbone of our work in Disaster Recovery plan, 
business continuity plans and much else the SRE community does.

# What make's for a good eponymous principle?

* True - with empirical evidence
* True - with weight of lived experience
* Predictive or explanatory value

# Godwin's Law

* As an online discussion grows longer, the probability it will involve Nazis approaches 1
 . * _Mike Godwin, 1980_
* In online discussions, **Go(o)d** never **Wins**

^ While true in our lived experience, 
it doesn't have useful predictive or explanatory value. Still
it let's us appreciate the Internet's finer moments such as:

# Conway's Law

* Organizations which design systemsâ€¦are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations" (1968)
  * _Melvin Conway, 1968_
* Or: Your architecture will mirror your org chart
* _Mnemonic_: We **CON**struct systems mirroring the **WAY** we communicate

^Pathological organization cultures and structures
will result in pathological technical systems

# The Inverse Conway Maneuver

* Build teams to achieve the desired architecture
* Tech: Used bounded contexts and APIs along team bounds
* Orgs: Consider _Team Topologies_ (Skelton and Pais, 2019)

# Fill in the blank

We have five teams assigned to a system that only has three 
major components. Time to apply an Inverse ________ Maneuver
so we don't end up with five subsystems.

# Answer: CONWAY

We have five teams assigned to a system that only has three 
major components. Time to apply an Inverse **Conway** Maneuver
so we don't end up with five subsystems.

* We CONstruct systems the same WAY we're organized

# Fill in the blank

This proposed architecture is too complex. We'll have to start
with a simpler initial _working_ solution, otherwise we're doomed
by _______ Law.

# Answer: Gall's Law

This proposed architecture is too complex. We'll have to start
with a simpler initial _working_ solution, otherwise we're doomed
by **Gall's Law**.

* ðŸ’© architecture -> digestion -> evolution -> Gall bladder

Closing: There's a lovely site called "Laws of Software" -- concise and helpful. I'm gong to contribute these to that site.
